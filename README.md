This repository contains the Python-based modelling and optimization framework developed for the analysis and optimization of multi-stage screw compressors. The framework integrates physics-based thermodynamic models with machine learning and Bayesian optimization techniques to enhance the design, efficiency, and performance of multi-stage screw compressors.

Overview
The framework provides a structured methodology for optimizing screw compressor parameters using batch file execution and simulation environments such as SCORG and GT-SUITE. It employs advanced optimization techniques like:

Bayesian Optimization
Evolutionary Algorithms
Repetitive Parameter Sweeps
It also features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive use.

Features
‚úÖ Modular Python Code: Easily adaptable to different optimization scenarios.
‚úÖ Automated Batch Execution: Interfaces with SCORG & GT-SUITE simulations.
‚úÖ Advanced Optimization Algorithms: Implements Bayesian Optimization and Differential Evolution.
‚úÖ Performance Metric Extraction: Reads outputs, processes results, and visualizes optimization progress.
‚úÖ Graphical User Interface (GUI): Tkinter-based GUI for user-friendly input handling and execution.
